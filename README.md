# Advanced-DL
Probelm Statement:
Facial recognition is a biometric alternative that measures unique characteristics of a human
face. Applications available today include flight check in, tagging friends and family members in
photos, and “tailored” advertising. You are a computer vision engineer who needs to develop a
face recognition programme with deep convolutional neural networks.
Objective: Use a deep convolutional neural network to perform facial recognition using Keras.
Dataset Details:
ORL face database composed of 400 images of size 112 x 92. There are 40 people, 10 images
per person. The images were taken at different times, lighting and facial expressions. The faces
are in an upright position in frontal view, with a slight left-right rotation.
